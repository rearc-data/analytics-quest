# Rearc Data Analytics Quest

### Q. What is this quest?
At Rearc, we're passionate about telling stories with our data: exploring it to better understand the world around us and leveraging it to create innovative solutions to real-world problems. 

With that in mind, we would like you to explore the dataset(s) provided and use your creativity to draw compelling insights from the data.

### Q. What do I have to do?
The goal of this quest is to showcase your data analytics skills. If you are an expert at extracting valuable insights from data, by all means do that. If you consider yourself a master designer of beautiful and informative visualizations, you may of course do that as well. If you are curious and like to ask questions / make predictions of data, then you may do that too.

This is intended to give you a platform to put your analytical expertise on display, so feel free to exercise creativity and do your thing!
